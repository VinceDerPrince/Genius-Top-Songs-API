# Genius-Top-Songs-API
An API to get the top songs listed on genius.com

![Use Example](Example.gif)

## Setup
### Virtual Environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Or use any virtual environment you like.

### Uvicorn
To show the UI I used in the Introduction, we use uvicorn.
You do this as such:
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
It should know look like this in your terminal and a browser Window with the API UI should show up.

## Need To Know
This API is not to be used neither is being used for commercial use exists to hurt the [genius.com](https://www.genius.com/) site. 
The API was created because I want to practice my API developing and web scraping skills!
